Her show is both entertaining and informative. There's also warm, genuine vibe that comes through. It makes you feel like you're in good hands. Love that you are incorporating spanish! Awesome we need more Latinx podcast:) Jen does such a great job of talking about money in a way that is relatable and doesn't feel like a lecture! So glad she decided to start this podcast and have women talking about money! Great job, Jen! I look forwarrd to Jen's podcast every week! Jen's interviews are fresh, raw and motivating. I love how she doesn't just talk to guests about practical money skills and budgeting. She gets at the heart of the matter by discussing money mindset and personal money stories. Thanks Jen for sharing your knowledge and work. I love this podcast about money from Jen Hemphill. With her warm, engaging style, she brings fantastic helpful information about money in a respectful and relatable way. I highly recommend it. Jen’s Podcast is one that has quickly made its way into my normal listening schedule. I like how she hits topics like insurance, explaining financial services and other similar topics. She gives some great information about every day finances that we all need to consider keep it simple and easy to understand. Jen, Thank you for bringing all of your amazing guests to your audience. This episode was especially really interesting for me. Dr. Wells had a wonderful money role model in her dad and the story fascinated me. Love how you asked about her challenges, money story and brought her story to life. Great job, I'm looking forward to more podcasts! There are a few shows out there that give you great content, and then others that give you a great host, but there are very few that give you the one two punch! Jennifer Hemphill brings valuable advice and a fresh perspective to Money while staying approachable and fun. Well done! Ok I'am learning so much and getting so inspired. By what I hear. I have a general knowledge of money mgmt. But this lady has guest that are practical, relatable, and still amazing. I'm so glad I found this one. I've been recommending podcasts for authors and author-hopefuls. This one isn't just for writers (or really just for females either) but figuring out the money-making side of things can keep many of us (writers and women) locked into choosing between having time or $. Enter Jen Hemphilll's approachable podcast which helps to demystify the whole leveling up thing to help us break through to financial freedom, security, and Independence. Jen’s podcast is so great because it’s REAL. She doesn’t beat around the bush with money topics - but she also keeps the conversation light and fun. Listen in if you’re looking for some real, relatable, and fun money advice! I really enjoy this podcast. As someone who is finally beginning to take control of her finances, I really appreciate the good information presented in this podcast. It's informative but not intimidating at all. I really enjoy the interesting people she interviews, as well. Keep up the great work! Love Jen’s guests and questions. She is inspiring, challenging and the perfect find for the new year! I love financial education. And I love quality financial education sources even more. This is one of those sources. Thanks Jen for all your hard work. I love that Jen gets right to the heart of what really matters when it comes to money... no fluff- just Real. Actionable. Advice! Jen is such an important voice in the sisterhood of women who are supporting other women to rise up and take control of our money. She’s relatable and compassionate, and takes great care to create a show that’s full of good technical content as well as encouraging content about how women can manage the emotions that come along with money. As a fellow podcaster, I really respect what Jen is doing and you won’t be disappointed with this show! Thank you, Jen, for giving me hope in a dark time.  You are an angel. This show is empowering and full of incredible content! No one is going to care more about your money than you will and Jen really gives great tips and insight to help us do just that! Love this podcast! Jen has the ability to make you feel like she’s your real life friend who just happens to be a money professional. I really enjoy this podcast and Jen’s take on money matters. The interviews so far have been great as well, I look forward to the future guests! With all of the different podcasts available today, very few of them stand out as exceptional. If you want to hear one which is truly worth every minute of your time, subscribe to Jen’s. Lots of great tips. Well put together. The HMM podcast is a straightforward money/finances/budgeting show with a special twist to focus on moms who are taking care of their families and their businesses.  Jennifer Hemphill is such a warm, friendly and likeable host.  She can take the sticky money matters and lessen the uneasiness that some of us feel about our talking about our finances! So glad I found this podcast!!! I need all the help I can get when it comes to finance and Jen does an amazing job talking about it in a way that I can understand.  She is really fun to listen too! Can't wait for more episodes!!! Jen is a great host and the content is golden! Thanks for sharing so much value. Can't wait to see what's coming up on future episodes. Don't listen to this show unless you're ready to get motivated to improve your financial life. Jen's a master of her money and so relatable in her style and interviews of guests. Such a great show! I've just started listening and the one thing that grabbed me right away was Jen's authentic voice. You can tell she really wants to help us all get a handle on our money and get the most out of life. Keep up the good work, Jen! You are making a difference! And happy anniversary! I love your show and really enjoyed your interview with Ilean Harris. I found myself reflecting on the points Ilean made about investing in yourself and that by envisioning the lifestyle we want, we aren't a slave to money – rather, it becomes a tool for us to use to enjoy what we love in life. I really like listening to Her Money Matters for the interviews, as well as your personal takeaway at the end of each episode. Keep up the awesome work! Jen is a warm and knowledgeable host. Her podcast is motivating and fun to listen to! Jennifer is a great speaker and provides awesome advice for any gal wanting to make savings x Jen does a great job at interviewing her guests and sharing financial information that will help people on their path to financial success! They don't teach you this stuff in school, so Jen's podcast is critical for empowering women to become money advocates for themselves and take ownership of their financial situation. Don't go at it alone. Use Her Money Matters to help you move your financial life forward! Jen and her guests share actionable and inspiring lessons on how to confidently manage your finances.

Highly recommend listening and subscribing to Her Money Matters if you want the knowledge AND mindsets to build a healthier relationship with your money (and inch closer towards financial freedom as a result)! As a single woman, with no support system when it comes to finances, I am finding your podcasts very helpful and informative as they address women's relationship with money, our attitudes, struggles and fears toward it. This is making a difference. Thank you. This podcast is basically one long commercial for her paid program.  She interviews people who claimed to have gone through the training and asks them a bunch of questions that are pretty much, ""Why should everyone do this program?""  There is NO content, no information.  And it is sooo boring. Save your time and enjoy other podcasts: Hermoney with Jean Chatsky, Listen Money Matters, or even Stacking Benjamins.  At least you will be entertained, and will pick up some good advice as well. Jen does a great job helping people get motivated and be sensible with their money. She shares great ideas that can make you smarter with budgeting and being confident about money. Thank you, Jen, for all you do for us women and for your exciting new book! I highly recommend it! Could be His Money Matters too because some great advice that transcends the sexes. Started listening  to it recently and now my wife is hooked as well. I love the podcast that Jen has put together and am very excited for ladies to get their hands on it.  Jen’s approach to confidence in finances WILL change the way you think about money, and set you up for the financial freedom you’ve always wanted.  Love the new show Jen! Very glad I came across you and your podcasts! Loved you getting to know the real you from your first podcast.
I definitely feel the guilt and feeling overwhelmed when it comes to ""money talk"".  I would love to see more podcasts about creating a budget.  I have created a budget in the past but only been able to stick to it for a couple months and then because it wasn't a very quick and simple system I got busy with life and stop focusing on it. Help! I came accross Jen's podcast a few months back after being connected through a Facebook group we are both part of. I am one of those people completely obsessed with personal finance topics as well as general ""money matters"" but I am very selective with the kind of content I read and listen to. After all, time is limited! This is one of those shows I'd highly recommend. Jenn is super fun and transparent in all of her episodes. She also has guest that offer tons of value to the listener while also offering practical steps to improve finances. I love that she has her own episodes in addition to bringing on guests. All in all, great content. Keep up the great work! Una mujer emprendedora y con un sentido del humor igual que el mío! Escucho el podcast y siento como estuviera en una charla con una amiga! Mil gracias por tus enseñanzas ! y más orgulloso me da es que eres colombiana al igual que yo ! Jen does a great job at bring on guest to share their money story. If you think your alone when it comes to your money and pursuing financial security, you're not. This podcast will give you the confidence to help you pursue your money goals. Love this podcast and the rebrand. The graphics are sharp. I look forward to listening when the new season launches. Jen is a great host, teacher, and invites fab guests. I found this podcast in October of 2018, due to some circumstances beyond our control our financial life was a shambles. I had no idea where to start. I began listening, took advantage of the free resources that was offered and applying what seemed to fit our situation. It worked. I highly recommend Jen Hemphill and Her Dinero Matters if you are looking for content regarding how to manage personal finance geared towards women and growing financial confidence.",Her Money Matters,education-how-to,No one is going to care more about your money than you will and Jen really gives great tips and insight to help us do just that! I love that Jen gets right to the heart of what really matters when it comes to money... I really enjoy this podcast and Jen’s take on money matters.,"Jen's show is both entertaining and informative . there's also warm, genuine vibe that comes through ."
05e74ae86b75256deabe004cf7267b0b,"4 minutes in and he’s still talking about his sponsor You talk too fast. I’m four minutes in and I’ve heard two commercials and about His animals nothing that’s motivated me at all matter fact I’m turning it off. I find the speaker pompous and arrogant, and it seems like he just likes to hear himself talk. I listened to a few of the podcasts and kept hoping it would get better but I didn't find it at all inspirational or motivational or even that interesting. Smith talks about himself like he's awesome (""I'm a really interesting guy"") and it's kind of tedious and repetative. I get a lot more out of podcasts like Inspire Nation or Fire it Up with CJ Liu. Just started listening to Scott today and after a few episodes I am hooked. Very simple approach. I am a small business owner and this is exactly what I need to start my day. Thanks. I’m a free spirited, laid back person who can sometimes be mistaken for lazy, which I am not. But my laid back personality can sometimes get in the way of getting things done. This podcast has helped me to get my day started on the right path so I can have the motivational push I need to stay on track with my goals. 
My favorite thing about the podcast is that it is only 3 minutes long. Advice is given in well-thought, succinct quips that pack a quick punch to your brain. 
Only slight irritation that I let pass because I can understand the why, is that it takes about 3 minutes to get through the ads to get the quick nuggets of advice. But I don’t mind, I’m sure it is his way of funding the podcast to make it happen. I listened to your shows for a full year when they were daily, and stopped when my boyfriend died. When I came back you did one episode a week and the first one I watched you were talking about how lazy and incompetent millennials are. I'm so sick of old people thinking we're stupid and unjustifiably bashing our generation. You have great insight and I enjoy listen to your advise. BUT I need you to stop rambling for 5 minutes about the sponsorships, let’s get to it! If you do enjoy advertising them, let’s make your podcast a little longer to make up for what went off tangent on :) Half the podcast is a ad. Thanks for the boost! 60% of the podcasts are unsubtle ads! I enjoy this podcast series. He gives me motivation and new ideas on how to take care of my life and be positive. The Daily Boost is nothing more than a boost to the host's own ego. 

Every episode is the same. He spends several minutes touting how long he's been doing podcasts, how many downloads he has, then he promotes his product (a tired, beaten down service that sends you fluffy reminders to do simple things for an exorbitant price), proceeds to  admonish you for not buying his service, continues by reminding  you the true ""secrets of success"" are behind his paywall, and then accuses you of being incompetent if you don't buy into his program. 

This guy gives the Scientologists a run for their money in terms of self aggrandizement and aggressive marketing. 

Give YOURSELF a ""Boost"" - don't waste 10 minutes of your life listening to this guy. You'll walk away feeling worse than you did before. This guy is promoting himself. He sounds like a used car lot commercial. Great podcast! This show was great before. Half of the shows now are sponsor ads and for his business. I know promotion for your product is important for growth but at least add more substance. I have found a new podcast called BREATHE Motivation that is daily and has been a lot more substance and doesn't have the sponsor feel and is geared towards daily success. Unfortunately- very little here. Certainly nothing new. When you finally get past the ads and listen to what’s actually said it hardly seems worth the effort. Literally a waste of my time listening to this full of ads and very little useful information Lots of ads, and he mostly just talks about himself the whole time. I’ll give anything a chance or just once. In this case I listened to two different episodes approximately 12 minutes long each. The first four minutes are for ads and the last minute or two is for self-promotion. One star & unsubscribe. Wish the ads/promotions for companies that sponsor the podcast weren't so long - seems like a big advertising listen which you have to skip over to get to the title topic. But overall, very informative podcast and great topics that are covered. Seems like a 10min advertisement I have head you in my ears on and off for a few years now and every time I start feeling trapped in life I put you on and it doesn’t take me much time to figure out the right path. When I forget “my way” you remind me how to get it back. Your so down to earth and almost every time I put you on it feels like your talking right to me. I love it cause it’s that kick in the butt that I need to keep me in my goals! First 3 minutes wasted talking about dog treats and the rest of the time very annoying background music 👎🏽👎🏽 Love starting my week listening to this very motivating podcast ! Some episodes hit home harder than others but each episodes teaches me something ! Half of the podcast seems like ads. I love these podcasts and they help so much. BUT, for the first 2-3 minutes (sometimes even longer) all is talked about is sponsors and products. Just hearing that gives me anxiety..we are being sold everything all the time. Please make these podcasts more about the subject and not the revenue..I know ads are your way to make money but it’s too much. It is making me want to stop listening..:( I decided to give this podcast a try so I listened to the August 21st episode. In a 9 minute podcast he spent the first 3:45 minutes talking about his other programs and advertising himself and the last 20 seconds doing the same. If you’re going to make a 9 minute podcast, don’t put in 4 minutes of self promotion, especially at the beginning. The actual content was ok. Definitely not worth waiting through all the self-advertising at the beginning though. 5 minute long spiel on how this accounting software changes lives, no thanks. I started listening to one of the episodes that is ~9 minutes long and I only made it to 3.5 mins then I had to turn it off.   All I heard were ads! A third of your episode is ads!? Ridiculous.  Way too greedy.  I won’t listen to another episode. Thanks for all the great advice Scott The old content was better before he restructured it. It’s mostly just filler talk now, sadly. I’ve only listened to a few. Wow. This podcast isn’t very long, but too many minutes are devoted to advertising at the beginning. Today’s episode is 10 minutes. There was idle chatter and nonsense for 4.5 minutes before the content began. One of the most annoying podcasts in life. I’ve never unsubbed so quickly. My one & only 9 minutes daily podcast for the past 4 years ! I downloaded a few podcasts on meditation, positivity, and mindfulness. This has been the worst one I've listened to yet. I downloaded 3 episodes and listened to two and had to delete them. Guy comes across so smarmy. I can't listen to his voice and way of talking. It irritates me. The advice he gives too just seems like the most obvious, run-of-the-mill stuff you can see on any greeting card from hallmark. Let me start by saying this is the first review I have ever made on a podcast. The Daily Boost is the very first podcast I had EVER listened to and it is the reason I even started listening to podcast in the first place.

I used to love this podcast so much, he was like father you never had in the movies, the one that you randomly come across in the park one day and realize he has a vast amount of knowledge. So, you spend every Tuesday afternoon frantically racing to that green bench in the park so he can drop some insightful knowledge that will revamp your entire week, giving you the sense that life is going to be okay and it’s not as hard as you think because you have a fair amount of control over your hopes, flaws, dreams, and aspirations. 

About a year ago, I played an episode for my spouse and it was completely out of the norm (I.e. not so good), I gave a nervous laugh (😅) and started fast forwarding before eventually turning it off and saying “Um, don’t judge that one, maybe he is just having an off day.” I’ll play it again someday👀. 

Today however, I was completely embarrassed playing his “One Question Stops Procrastination” from November 12, 2018.  What was said in this episode was completely unattractive, it was absolute NONSENSE. He should be ashamed of himself for finding amusement in this bad advice, bad approach, and his pompous (arrogant) behavior. I hope he listens to this podcast again and reevaluates his reasoning behind be putting this type of content out. I don’t mean to sound whiny or sensitive, that’s not my intention. People trust him, I trusted him (which is shocking), people confide in him about seriously debilitating mental health issues and more. He is losing credibility, a loyal fan base, and himself.

It was mortifying to see how my spouse looked at me for recommending “an amazing podcast that could touch the soul of anyone who listened.” This is bad, really bad. It’s like there is a whole new person impersonating a man without that doesn’t have one arrogant bone in his body. A man you could literally confide in about anything.

November 12, 2018-“On Question Stops Procrastination” is a 14 minute podcast. 7 out of those 14 minutes was dedicated to commercials and advertising. I remember hearing a podcast from long ago where he talked about not liking that advertisements were everywhere and that’s not how he operates. What is he doing? Why? 7 minutes of commercials/ads out of a 14 minute podcast is not only insane, but honestly in unacceptable. 

Read the reviews, everyone is saying the same thing! This change wasn’t for the better. Tried listening. 11 minutes of a podcast. 8 of those seemed like ads. Meh. Very motivational and wakes me up in the morning mentally and physically. I look forward to hearing Scott each morning. This boost works for me and I find myself much more hopeful in the morning. Plus, love being able to support another person from Florida! I thought this would be right up my alley from reading other reviews. However, most of the episodes are half advertisements. Who wants to sit, or scroll, through 4 minutes of adds in an 8 minute podcast? Too much advertising I’m sorry, I usually don’t write reviews at all but all we as listeners have to go on is your voice. The baby talk she did in this one episode I tried listening too made me cringe. Consider it constructive criticism! This man right here!!!! Helped me dig back out what I always knew was there! Broke out of my comfort zone, pushed myself, set goals, didn’t give up and accomplished a goal that has been 6 years in the making! Thank you This guy sounds like he’s on crack, and has one of the most annoying voices. His podcasts are only 6 minutes long, (4mins are literally him promoting something). Scott Smith is funny, genuine, and creative. God knows how many people he has helped over the 10++ years he's been doing the Daily Boost, but he has created a dynamite legacy and endlessly works to help you create yours. This is such an abhorrent podcast. Not only is half of the podcast trivial underwriter promotions, but it also contains 0% useful knowledge. I come here to be motivated; hackneyed bromides don’t get the job done whatsover! Fix it or leave it bro I'd like to judge this podcast based on its content , unfortunately i wasnt able to get muh of the actual podcast.  I downloaded a 12 minute episode to find the first 4 minutes of the episode was taken up by two diferent commcerials for the same service.  I undersand that this is a free podcast and they need to keep the lights on but when a third of the epsiode is spent selling the same item I just cant imagine how much substance will be worth the wait. He takes way too long to get to the point. A good premise for the show, but as it is 50% advertising - this is not a productive way to self-motivate. I have been listening to this podcast daily for 6 months now. I’m enjoying hearing positive encouragement which has helped me keep going daily & believe in myself as I am making my new life. I understand needing quick advertisements at the beginning, middle, and end of a podcast - but more than half of it was a commercial! Waste of time if you want real content For over 6 years, I have loved starting my day listening to this podcast as I pull out of my driveway. The perfect jolt of humor, clarity and orientation to get me in the zone. 
Sadly, it is only Monday now. The premium subscription comes with way more than I am looking for and you have to pay accordingly.
It would be perfect if there was a way to just get the podcast without paying for everything else. Boring😴 Complete waste of time unless Apple podcast makes a “skip forward 7 minutes” button to get through the majority of these episodes that are completely filled with ads. Half of an entire episode can be dedicated to advertisements. When an episode is typically only about 11 or 12 minutes long, that’s not really a substantial amount of useful information.",The Daily Boost | Daily Coaching and Motivation,health-fitness,"The Daily Boost is the very first podcast I had EVER listened to and it is the reason I even started listening to podcast in the first place.

I love your style and your wit. You have a great way of making me feel like I am not alone and my impatience is warranted. I so appreciate the occasional cuss word because I finally feel like someone out there gets it! Thank you! Love this podcast! Robyn has such a calming and reassuring voice. I love listening to her and she has some great useful information. Fertility struggles are hard and it's always good hearing you're not alone. Love this podcast!

They talk crypto and pressure you every episode into writing a review for their podcast. Here it is! Good topics, great hosts, Chambers sound bites are amazing and they always have interesting guest! @Back2Crypto Light and funny. 

Easy to listen to and Chamber and Bunchu are hilarious. Great cryptocurrency insight and content. To have all three opinions offered on a single podcast is great. I’m learning that blockchaintech and crypto investing and its successor is a long game and to factor in everyone’s opinion is critical to making wise unwrekt decisions. Pretty cringey imo Love the show! Never missed an episode and sometimes listen to them twice. Chambers is my fave- however bunch and C are a close second. Best financial advice I ever gotten: “don’t get REKT” Just kidding, Bunchu and Chambers bring it each episode! I was personally subbed to 10+ crypto podcasts and now listen to 3 and Rekt survived!
Both of the hosts make it in a majority of the episodes (rare in crypto podcasts)and it's a bonus when Cynthia makes it on. They also have some of the best guests. Hosted by a serial doxxer who threatens people and doxes their kids
Stay away Informative content guys, fun banter, and superb guests! Wasted crypto mom (Cynthia) is something else though. Hah! No shame in her game! She’s a piece of work! This podcast is an awesome blend of fun and content. Three hosts work well together and have had an awesome guest list so far.  Informative and light hearted. Fun and informative.

e2984116d5ec9faa9710680cb369d88e,"I stumbled upon these podcasts when I was looking for insight into the illustration and concept art industry, I found it and much more. I highly recomend anyone with similar interests check these out, they are at minimum full of uplifting advice for anyone struggling to find their place in such a highly competetive industry. Love this podcast!!! Often listen to episodes while I travel . Really keeps me motivated. Chris Oatley's art cast is all inspirational, informative and helpful as you can get. Every episode gets me excited about all the new information and artists I'm going meet - it's always a very positive journey. So here it is, to keep company while you are alone in your studio - you couldn't get any better. I have been listening to Chris Oatley’s podcasts (all of them: Artcast, Paper Wings, Stories Unbound.. is that all of them?) and they have really helped me grow as an artist and storyteller. It kept me company during the loneliest and dryest time in my art career and the warm and empathetic hosts felt like my friends. Thanks for continuing to make these, Chris and friends! Chris Oatley’s podcast and the companion show, Paper Wings, is honestly such a great resource.  Not only does the show provide great, practical advice, ranging from portfolio tips to how to get a job in the industry, the show truly motivates me.  The show encourages you in whatever artistic endeavor you pursue and if you ever need an artistic pick-me-up, just give the podcast a listen.  You won’t regret it.  Whether you’re in animation, comic books, visual development, whatever, this show is awesome and helpful. Are you an aspiring artist who works a full time job he hates while working to become a digital artist with the rest of his time? Then listen to these during your lunch break on your iPod. They’re totally worth keeping up the inspiration! Chris Oatley is the best teacher I know and he really cares about helping artists. I have gotten so much great advice and inspiration from his podcasts. His guests have been awesome also. Keep up the great work Chris! I've already learned so much from this artcast. Probably more than I ever did in my art college. Do yourself a favor and listen to all of these! This podcast's main purpose is to kindle/rekindle your passion to do art. Chris fills it with great information on becoming a better artist as well as inspiring you to get off your duff and do something amazing! I look forward to every episode! Keep it up, Chris! Incredibly insightful advice from a warm heart. As an artist trying to start an illustration career, I'm always looking for new ideas or information to help further my goals.  Look no further.  Chris Oatley brings not only his experience as a Disney visual developer to the conversation but other industrial veterans as well to tell you how it is.  But more importantly, Chis Oatley lets you know you're not alone in your struggles and there are many out there with the same questions you have and tries to answer them all.  Combine this podcast with his online academy ""The Magic Box,"" and you couldn't ask for a better well of knowledge. If you are an artist of any kind, download this right now. Chris brings the big mythical idea of the ""industry"" to you in bite-sized, realistic bits that will both encourage and teach you. Chris also has a real heart for teaching and his passion for art is contagious. Artists now, more than ever, need real hope and that is exactly what you will find. Ahoy

Are you lost in your creative struggle? do you feel ill equipped for the battle with your inner villains and creative walls? Well stop right there!! 

Come inside and rest with The Guru with the Huge Heart! Chris is an amazing person and an otherworldly teacher. If your super powered talents need a recharge and boost then I personally believe that he will be one of the best allies your creative efforts could ever have!!!!

In all seriousness, There are amazing tools and tips that are taught through these podcasts and Chris does an amazing job of also giving hope to we creatives who are struggling with growing our talents and personal careers. 

He has made a great positive impact on my creativity and life and if you follow along, I believe he can help yours too! 

My best to all of you in your journeys to awesomeness! I work as a provisional theme park designer and film animator and I’m instantly involve with this podcast. I've been listening to this show for years now and am incredibly grateful to Chris for this amazing resource. It has been inspirational, educational, and quite encouraging at times while still being very realistic and honest. The degree to which Chris really sincerely cares about the art community is astounding. Such a great guy. Do give it a listen! I listen to these while working on my projects. Many I listen to more than once. Insight, knowledge, humor, and inspiration literally pours out through the interviews and anecdotes given by Chris Oatley and many other professionals out there. Honestly wouldn’t be where I am without it. This really is a great podcast. I was blown away by how nearly everything Chris and his guests talked about are things that I had been unsure about, struggling with, or wasn’t even aware that I was unsure about struggling with. And I was blown even further away by how motivating and reassuring these talks were. 

If you have any interest in anything artistic, I’d highly recommend giving this podcast a chance. Chris gives awesome insights and great encouragement on the artcast.  This is a fantastic place to check out! This podcast may be aimed at illustrators but it is chockfull of excellent advice, insight and discussions that are applicable to any type of artist.  Chris Oatley is extremely passionate about what he does and it's infectious.  Can't recommend enough. Want to learn? Want to be inspired? Then you've come to the right guy. Brace yourself and get ready to be blown away. I've only just started listening, but unfortunately the message on how to be a good freelancer that's being sold here is that you have to buy what he's selling, and the guests seem to be reading from a script to endorse him. I'll stick around and hope for the best! Pursuing a career in art has never been a clear cut path for me but this podcast always seems to nail the hard questions I’ve always struggled with. I feel like it has put me on a more sensible track in terms of education, networking and work ethic. I don’t know if the creative world will ever make consistent sense, but I’m VERY grateful for the clarity this podcast provides. Meaning to write this for a long time- this is my top favorite, top quoted, and most encouraging podcast I listen to while I work. I not only love the subject matter, but I love the show hosts as well. Thank you so much for all your hard work and providing this free resource to everyone. You're the best. I just started listening to the podcast and love it. Not coming from an art background I find a lot of tips and tricks to be very applicable to other creative fields. Definitely worth listening to! Chris Oatley's podcasts are inspirational. He gives you tips to staying on track as an artist. If you are a professional, or long to be, these podcasts will help you. A lot of artists struggle with routine, but routine is extremely important in creating work and completing projects. Even if you just need a push to get started with something you've been dragging your feet on, give a listen. i promise these podcasts will help. I am a fairly new fan of Chris Oatley’s podcasts and learning materials but what I’ve listened to and learned so far is priceless. Chris shares a wealth of knowledge, not just about art techniques and processes but what it’s like to actually be an artist. He puts a name and description to many of the more challenging aspects and talks about about how to conquer them: working alone (and how lonely that can be!), finding inspiration, sticking to a project, working through failed projects, doing the painful work of planning…and much more. 

I look forward to listening to all that he has to say and I’m appreciative of his willingness to share it with the rest of us. And now, off to listen to another podcast! I've been listening for a few years & it's always a great listen. Started listening as a student & I continue listening as a animation professional. Thanks for the effort and great work man! It's been great to hear the topics, advice, and interviews with industry professionals on what works, doesn't work, and everything in between. Great show, Chris. I can't say enough great things about this series. It is so helpful as well as entertaining to hear what professionals have to say about how they got into their respective careers. This is a great series to listen to while working on artwork. It keeps me motivated and gives some much desired insight into the industry. This and papers wings are really good for artists looking to get some practical tips to help there writing and to help pitch it This podcast is amazing at energizing and inspiring the youth in the art industry. It’s about precisely identifying what artists need to do to get better and how to get there. Chris is very talented at reaching out and motivating you in the best way possible. Give it a listen! I wait intently for new episodes of the Art Cast as well as the Paper Wings show which has now merged over. What's shared is thoughtful, qualified, insightful, and MOST IMPORTANTLY inspiring. There are few other resources in any creative field that motivate one to reach for excellence. Because of the high quality of the show, the Oatley Academy caught my interest, and I've learned more in the first lesson about digital painting than anywhere else, and now I feel empowered. I'm so glad I found this podcast which eventually led me there. Please give an episode that interests you a listen. The actual interviews with working artists in this podcast are GREAT! However, they are bookended with weird segments from the host's students in a very thinly veiled attempt to push his online school. Skip past those weird segments and just dig into the interviews. When you have time for podcast, just tun on this one! I love to draw while listening, it allows to create and learn things at the same time. Highly recommend! This is such a fantastic podcast for anyone interested in art, design, writing, what-have-you. Chris is just such a sweet, humble guy and has so many good thoughts to share. Not only is this podcast fun and informative--it is also clean--so I feel comfortable recommending the podcast to younger artists/art enthusiasts (including my 11 and 16 year old brothers and art students). Chris Oatley has helped me so much with his podcasts and everything else he does to help those interested in the art industry. He is a huge source of inspiration and provides amazing advice and techniques to offer new perspectives and better understandings of many concepts. I look up to him and find myself listening and re-listening to his stories and personal experiences, especially while I paint! Chris Oately shares so much great information on succeeding as a artist.

Nice show Superb👌🏻 The hosts have a great chemsitry and energy!  They are honest with their opinions and you can tell they are having a blast while recording.  Try them out! Have to give it up to these two hosting a great podcast with really informative reveiws! Not super current with movies but i can rely on this show to tell it like it is!

 Listened to the Deadpool 2 ep and they nailed it and i agree 5/5 great movie! Super binge worthy! Fun hosts! Make sure you subscribe! Each episode has so much to listen to! If you are a fan of movies (and I am) you will love this pod. There is a good blend of mainstream movies and indie favorites. Do yourself a favorite and subscribe to this pod! 

Its nice to have the POV of a man and woman. It creates a more Interesting dynamic than another pod with 2-4 dudes. 

First Reformed was great though, I disagree on that. 😎 Dani and Dillyn are really having fun with these movie reviews. Their chemistry is clear and their love of film comes through. When they pair movies that are thematically juxtaposed they are at their best. This is a great movie review podcast. I certainly do not always agree with their opinions which of course if not the point. (Such as their views on Rouge One 😝) This duo gives me perspectives I may not have otherwise considered. Dillyn and Dani make me excited to go to the movies again which is rare for me and excited to rewatch films. Keep the episodes coming. This show is excellent! Perfect for long commutes. Just checked out the Quiet Place/Ready Player One episode and I’m hooked Dillyn and Dani are funny, insightful, and have good taste in movies. I really enjoy their movie reviews! Who doesn’t love a movie centered podcast featuring NEW movies that were just out in theaters?! As soon as you see a movie - you want to hear any and all reviews, so give this podcast a listen! Awesome podcast, great hosts! Very dope podcast. Very knowledgeable when it comes to films. This is definitely the right lane for y’all.

“Ep 4: Several Small Lies and One Big One” is a great place for new listeners to jump into the story and immerse themselves in the antics of Vim, Jorell, Cyrus, and Ardyn. They lands being created with the characters in question are mysterious and pull me back for more. Their strong editing and sound design paired with the playful characters round out all the things I need to fall in love with a actual Play podcast. This podcast starts with great quality right off the bat. It's well-edited and sound-designed, and the players are engaging to listen to. The relaxed pace and interesting characters make it a wonderfully immersive podcast to listen to. Candace does a masterful job keeping things moving at a good pace, and you can sense the joy when her players succeed and come up with silly plans. Cyrus is a hilarious crotchety old man, Ardyn is very serious, and Vim and Jorel work very well together. I wish more shows had this good of chemistry and characters! While still young, this podcast is really flexing its muscles in the best way possible. Production and editing is well done and does a great job to immerse listeners. The campaign players created interesting characters, thus designing an interesting chemistry among the group. Even with it being an actual play DnD podcast, I was surprised at how quickly I finished episodes on normal speed. Little Realms has done a wonderful job in spawning a detailed story with a mic and some friends. This is definitely a podcast I’m excited to listen to, and I’m sure it will get even better with time. Cyrus Sassafraz makes me giggle. 
Ardyn is so serious that I can't take him serious
And Vim & Jorel are a dynamic duo that I could listen to for days Highly recommend.  Great pace, very fun characters, editing is on point. Very fun, quick, and consumable episodes! Looking forward to more! Never played DnD but very interested now and found it easy to follow along I started listening to actual play pod casts a few months ago and after catching up to my original series I found you guys and I love the pod cast. I love the humor and fun that you all have and it’s been great. Please keep up the good work!!!",Little Realms | A DnD Actual Play Podcast,leisure,"It's well-edited and sound-designed, and the players are engaging to listen to.
