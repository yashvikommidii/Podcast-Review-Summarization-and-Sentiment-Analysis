***Introduction:***
Podcasts are a great way for people to learn, get inspired, or just relax.
With so many listeners tuning in, a lot of them leave reviews to share what they think. 
But going through all these reviews one by one can take a lot of time.
That’s where this project comes in. 
We used natural language processing (NLP) to automatically read, summarize, and understand podcast reviews. 
Instead of reading hundreds of long reviews, we created short summaries using two methods—TextRank and T5—that capture the main points.
We also used two sentiment analysis tools (VADER and BERT) to figure out if a review is positive, negative, or neutral. 
By combining summaries with emotions from the reviews, we get a better idea of how people feel about different podcasts.

This project helps podcast creators and platforms like Apple Podcasts or Spotify quickly understand listener feedback and improve their content.
