I found myself reflecting on the points Ilean made about investing in yourself and that by envisioning the lifestyle we want, we aren't a slave to money \u2013 rather, it becomes a tool for us to use to enjoy what we love in life. I really like listening to Her Money Matters for the interviews, as well as your personal takeaway at the end of each episode.

{"podcast_id":"05e74ae86b75256deabe004cf7267b0b","title_review":"What happened?","content":"Let me start by saying this is the first review I have ever made on a podcast. The Daily Boost is the very first podcast I had EVER listened to and it is the reason I even started listening to podcast in the first place.\n\nI used to love this podcast so much, he was like father you never had in the movies, the one that you randomly come across in the park one day and realize he has a vast amount of knowledge. So, you spend every Tuesday afternoon frantically racing to that green bench in the park so he can drop some insightful knowledge that will revamp your entire week, giving you the sense that life is going to be okay and it\u2019s not as hard as you think because you have a fair amount of control over your hopes, flaws, dreams, and aspirations. \n\nAbout a year ago, I played an episode for my spouse and it was completely out of the norm (I.e. not so good), I gave a nervous laugh (\ud83d\ude05) and started fast forwarding before eventually turning it off and saying \u201cUm, don\u2019t judge that one, maybe he is just having an off day.\u201d I\u2019ll play it again someday\ud83d\udc40. \n\nToday however, I was completely embarrassed playing his \u201cOne Question Stops Procrastination\u201d from November 12, 2018.  What was said in this episode was completely unattractive, it was absolute NONSENSE. He should be ashamed of himself for finding amusement in this bad advice, bad approach, and his pompous (arrogant) behavior. I hope he listens to this podcast again and reevaluates his reasoning behind be putting this type of content out. I don\u2019t mean to sound whiny or sensitive, that\u2019s not my intention. People trust him, I trusted him (which is shocking), people confide in him about seriously debilitating mental health issues and more. He is losing credibility, a loyal fan base, and himself.\n\nIt was mortifying to see how my spouse looked at me for recommending \u201can amazing podcast that could touch the soul of anyone who listened.\u201d This is bad, really bad. It\u2019s like there is a whole new person impersonating a man without that doesn\u2019t have one arrogant bone in his body. A man you could literally confide in about anything.\n\nNovember 12, 2018-\u201cOn Question Stops Procrastination\u201d is a 14 minute podcast. 7 out of those 14 minutes was dedicated to commercials and advertising. I remember hearing a podcast from long ago where he talked about not liking that advertisements were everywhere and that\u2019s not how he operates. What is he doing? Why? 7 minutes of commercials\/ads out of a 14 minute podcast is not only insane, but honestly in unacceptable. \n\nRead the reviews, everyone is saying the same thing!
